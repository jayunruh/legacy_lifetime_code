# Legacy Lifetime Code
This repo contains legacy VBA and c codes for fitting TCSPC lifetime data.  I also included modern python codes for recapitulating this capacity in python.  Finally, my Jay_Plugins package has a third implementation: https://github.com/jayunruh/Jay_Plugins/blob/master/fit_lifetime_jru_v1.java.

The VBA code is in the old_excel_code folder.

The fit_lifetime_data notebook describes the dependencies and the pixi.toml file allows for rapid installation using pixi.
